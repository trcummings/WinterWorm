# Winter Worm

### What is This?

Hello, I am Thomsen Cummings, and this is my own JavaScript adaptation of [Alex Kehayias' wonderful ClojureScript ECS](https://github.com/alexkehayias/chocolatier). 



WinterWorm is an Electron app that follows the Entity Component System model for creating a game engine, and uses Pixi.js on the frontend for rendering. It has a React/Redux entity editor on the frontend, and a hot reloadable runtime environment. While it is no longer an ongoing project, but I have decided to leave it public as a matter of historical curiosity for myself, and as a discussion point in future interviews.

### How to Run

1. yarn install
2. yarn app:devserver
